Processing Map for Hot Working of Metals
When a metallic alloy is subjected to deformation at high temperatures, it may undergo microstructural
changes through different mechanisms. Some of these (e.g., dynamic recrystallisation and dynamic
recovery) are known to be “‘safe’’ mechanisms, while others (e.g., void formation and wedge cracking) lead
to the formation of defects.'’! Processing maps depict the hot workability of an alloy, by combining
information about the ease with which its microstructure changes upon deformation with delineated regions
of unstable flow. As such, they can be a useful tool to assess the ideal processing conditions that ensure a
defect-free final product.''! This report provides an overview of the model used in JMatPro® to calculate
processing maps from flow stress data.
Power Dissipation Map
Processing maps are calculated in the framework of the dynamic materials model,''°! whereby the metallic
alloy in the hot working process (1.e., the workpiece) is described as a nonlinear dissipator. Crucially, the
power absorbed during plastic flow is written as a sum of two explicit functions of the flow stress, 0, and
strain rate, é:'-°.
P=G+J =f{ odét+f édo =o8
The first integral, G, known as the dissipator content, describes the power dissipated into heat, while J, the
dissipator co-content, is related to microstructural changes in the workpiece.!'*! Usually, G > J, and the
maximum co-content is obtained for a linear dissipator:"' 7!
Imax =>

9)
The efficiency of power dissipation is then defined as the ratio"!
The above quantity represents the ability of the workpiece to change its microstructure upon deformation.
It may be derived entirely from flow stress data, either measured experimentally or calculated from suitable
models. By plotting isovalue contours of 7 as a function of temperature, 7, and strain rate, a power
dissipation map is obtained.'' ”! This forms the first part of a processing map.
Instability Criteria
The mechanisms that produce defect-free microstructures during high-temperature deformation, namely
dynamic recrystallisation, superplasticity, and dynamic recovery,''! are associated with high efficiency of
power dissipation.'-! However, such is also the case for the detrimental mechanisms of void formation and
wedge cracking."'*! A power dissipation map alone is, thus, insufficient to fully characterise the hot working
behaviour of an alloy. In order to achieve this and, in particular, to optimise the processing parameters, it
is important to distinguish those undesirable regions of unstable flow. By using appropriate instability
criteria,!°*! it is possible to identify such regions and build an instability map, which when superimposed
on the isoefficiency contours results in the final processing map."'”!
Instability criteria may be established under a number of different assumptions. A common route 1s to apply
stability concepts from Ziegler’s plasticity theory to the dissipation functions of the dynamic materials
model. This approach leads to the Kumar-Prasad and Murty-Rao criteria,”*! respectively given by

The difference between conditions (4) and (5) is in the underlying form of the flow stress versus strain rate
curve. The Kumar-Prasad instability criterion assumes a power law relationship,
while the Murty-Rao one works for arbitrary curves.’*! When using the Kumar-Prasad criterion to outline
the regions of unstable flow, the efficiency of power dissipation is also often calculated with the above
constraint (Eq. 7).''*! In the JMatPro® implementation, however, the more general equation (3) is always
used to determine the power dissipation map. This follows closely the work of Murty et al.”! and calculated
results from the same data agree well with those of Ref. 3, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for the nickel-iron-based
superalloy IN718 (N1-0.5AI-19Cr-18.5Fe-3Mo-5.1Nb-0.2S1-0.9T1-0.04C wt%).
For most alloys at typical processing conditions used in hot working, the Kumar-Prasad and Murty-Rao
criteria lead to similar predictions. This is exemplified in Fig. 2, which shows a comparison of the
processing maps obtained considering both criteria for general steel 3310 (Fe-1.52Cr-0.45Mn-0.03 Mo-
3.33N1-0.18S1-0.11C-0.03P-0.04S wt%). The JMatPro® flow stress module was used to calculate the
required data to build these processing maps (typical stress-strain curves are also shown in Fig. 2).
Alternative criteria may be developed on the basis of Lyapunov’s stability theory, with Lyapunov functions
built from quantities introduced in the dynamic materials model. This approach leads to the Gegel and
Alexander-Malas criteria,'°*! respectively given by

The only difference between criteria sets (8) and (9) is in the second condition, with 7 in the Gegel version
replaced by m in the Alexander-Malas case. Again, for processing parameter ranges typical of hot working,
the regions of unstable flow predicted by the Gegel and Alexander-Malas criteria sets are very similar, as
illustrated in Fig. 3 for general steel 3310.
The JMatPro® module that deals with the calculation of processing maps allows the user to select one of
the instability criteria discussed here, but further possibilities exist.'°! It is important to stress that none of
the existing criteria is generally applicable to every material type and, in some cases, they can lead to
contradictory predictions, as can be seen by comparing the processing maps of Figs. 2 and 3. The
contradictory nature of various calculations has been reported previously in the literature'*! and care needs
to be taken when choosing which criterion to use.
Summary
Modelling of processing maps is a subject that has drawn some controversy. There are doubts about both
the rigorousness of the analytical approach and the correctness of the predicted results.'°*°! The situation is

is used and the interpretation of flow instability from the subsequently calculated processing map need to
be approached with caution. Nonetheless, processing maps appear to be seen as useful tools and are quite
